# Changelog

This project follows a lightweight changelog style inspired by Keep a
Changelog. Dates use `YYYY-MM-DD`.

## Unreleased

### Added

- RAG facade, reusable workflow nodes, and an in-process ingestion job queue.
- Integration smoke test guide for the main HTTP workflows.
- Controlled Project QA tool planner module and tool-call sequence debug output.
- Project Inventory field views for focused asset/code metadata answers.
- Bounded log-analysis ReAct debug trace.
- Lightweight CI for Ruff plus unit/contract tests.
- Public architecture and contribution docs.
- Project QA grounding unit tests for inventory-first project facts and generic
  UE knowledge separation.

  and stable highlight-card analysis output.

### Changed

- CI now avoids live LLM, Qdrant, UE editor, eval, and integration dependencies
  on push/pull request runs.
- Requirements files are documented as compatibility shims; `pyproject.toml`
  remains the dependency source of truth.
- RAG subpackage entry points now expose public contracts instead of
  placeholder-only package files.
